## About Me

I am a second-year master's student at the Software Engineering Institute of East China Normal University (2023-2026), fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chengcheng Wan](https://chengcheng-wan.github.io) and Prof. Geguang Pu.

My interests involve ***understanding, implementing, and optimizing systems and infrastructure***. Currently, I am focusing on and learning AI compilers (e.g., MLIR, IREE).  
Although my past research focused on a completely different area, I am excited to finally return to focusing on systems and infrastructure—an area I have been passionate about for a long time but have limited chance to explore during my master's studies.

## Past Research

My previous research focused on software engineering for LLM-enabled software.
